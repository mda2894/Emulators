# Emulators
My attempt at figuring out how to write basic CPU emulators. Not particularly concerned with being super efficient or modeling every aspect of the hardware. Just trying to write functional, readable code.

Currently working on the SAP (Simple As Possible) Computer from Malvino's "Digital Computer Electronics", which inspired Ben Eater's 8-bit Breadboard Computer. After that I hope to move on to some real world 8-bit computers like the Intel 8080 and MOS 6502. We shall see.
