# Emulators
My attempt at figuring out how to write basic CPU emulators. Not particularly concerned with being super efficient or modeling every aspect of the hardware. Just trying to write functional, readable code.

Currently working on SAP-1, with plans to build up through SAP-2, SAP-3, and potentially the Intel 8080 and MOS 6502 from there. We shall see.
