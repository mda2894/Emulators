potential improvements:
- implement Register class, and (possibly?) some sort of inheritance/dependence with the memory class
- implement instruction decoding with dictionary instead of match/case
- add ability to display full CPU state at once (registers, PC, IR, MAR, memory, etc)
- implement clock cycling, with properly timed microinstructions
- bus?
- assembler?
