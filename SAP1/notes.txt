Potential Improvements:
- (Done) implement Register class
- (Done) implement instruction decoding with dictionary instead of match/case
- (Done) add ability to display full CPU state at once (registers, flags, memory)
- implement clock cycling, with properly timed microinstructions
- implement step by step operation mode (by instruction or by clock pulse) for debugging
- flags register class
- bus?
- assembler?
